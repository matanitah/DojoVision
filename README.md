# DojoVision

## Overview
DojoVision is a Vision-Language Model (VLM) designed to analyze and correct martial arts form. Built on state-of-the-art computer vision and natural language processing techniques, DojoVision helps practitioners refine their technique by providing real-time feedback, identifying inconsistencies, and suggesting improvements based on biomechanical principles.

## Roadmap
- **Pose Estimation & Analysis:** Detects body positioning and movement patterns using deep learning.
- **Form Correction:** Provides feedback on martial arts techniques such as punches, kicks, stances, and transitions.
- **Customizable Training Modes:** Supports various martial arts disciplines, including Muay Thai, Jiu-Jitsu, Boxing, and Mixed Martial Arts.
- **Real-time & Post-Training Review:** Users can receive immediate feedback during practice or review detailed corrections afterward.
- **Multimodal Understanding:** Combines visual data with textual explanations for enhanced learning.
- **Progress Tracking:** Logs improvements over time to help users refine their skills.

## Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/DojoVision.git
cd DojoVision
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
### 1. Capturing Video
Ensure you have a camera set up to record your movements. The model can process real-time input or analyze pre-recorded footage.

### 2. Running DojoVision
```bash
python dojo_vision.py --input your_video.mp4
```

### 3. Reviewing Feedback
After analysis, DojoVision provides:
- A breakdown of errors in your form
- Suggested corrections with visual overlays
- A textual summary of improvements

## Model Training & Fine-Tuning
DojoVision was trained on a diverse dataset of martial arts movements, using transfer learning on top of state-of-the-art vision models. Fine-tuning was conducted using expert-labeled martial arts footage and biomechanical analysis to ensure accuracy in form correction.
